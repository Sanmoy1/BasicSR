# Inference of new Architecture

I'll help you set up inference with the new architecture. Let me create a plan for implementing this.

Let me help you set up inference with the new SRIB architecture. I'll create the necessary scripts for running inference on your cloud server dataset.

## Setting Up Inference with SRIB Architecture

I've created all the necessary files for running inference with the new SRIB architecture on your cloud server dataset. Here's a summary of what I've prepared:

### 1. Dedicated Inference Script (`inference_srib.py`)

This script is specifically for the SRIB architecture:
- Takes input from `/user/sanmoy/dataset`
- Supports scale factors (2x, 3x, 4x)
- Includes tiled processing for large images
- Handles error cases gracefully

### 2. Unified Inference Script (`inference.py`)

This script supports multiple architectures including your new SRIB model:
- Uses a `--model_type` parameter to select between architectures
- Maintains the same interface across different models
- Handles model-specific preprocessing requirements

### 3. Shell Script (`inference.sh`)

This script automates the entire inference process:
- Installs required packages
- Checks for CUDA availability
- Takes command-line arguments for model path, input/output directories, and scale
- Provides commented options for tiled processing of large images

### How to Run Inference

1. Upload your trained SRIB model to the server
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x inference.sh
   ```

3. Run inference with default parameters:
   ```bash
   ./inference.sh
   ```

4. Or specify custom parameters:
   ```bash
   ./inference.sh path/to/srib_model.pth /user/sanmoy/dataset results/my_output 4
   ```

### Additional Notes

- The scripts handle both CPU and GPU inference automatically
- For very large images, enable tiled processing by uncommenting the relevant section in `inference.sh`
- Results are saved with model name and scale in the filename for easy identification

These scripts follow the same pattern as the existing BasicSR inference scripts while adding support for your new SRIB architecture.
