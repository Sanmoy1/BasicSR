# Solutions for Eliminating Tiling Artifacts in Super-Resolution Models

Based on my research, here are several techniques beyond simple tile padding that can help eliminate tiling artifacts in your super-resolution model:

## 1. Weighted Blending / Feathering

**How it works:** Instead of hard transitions between tiles, apply a gradual weight transition in the overlapping regions.
- Create weight masks that gradually transition from 1 to 0 in the overlap regions
- Common weight functions include linear gradients, cosine (Hann window), or Gaussian functions
- The blended pixel = (tile1_pixel × weight1) + (tile2_pixel × weight2)

**Implementation:**
```python
def create_weight_mask(h, w, overlap):
    mask = np.ones((h, w))
    # Create gradual transition in overlap regions
    for i in range(overlap):
        weight = i / overlap  # Linear transition
        # or weight = 0.5 * (1 - np.cos(i / overlap * np.pi))  # Cosine transition
        mask[:, i] = weight
        mask[:, w-i-1] = weight
        mask[i, :] = weight
        mask[h-i-1, :] = weight
    return mask
```

## 2. Reflection Padding

**How it works:** Instead of zero-padding or replicating edge pixels, use reflection padding at the boundaries.
- Reflects the image content at boundaries, preserving texture continuity
- Reduces boundary artifacts by maintaining local statistics

**Implementation:**
```python
# Before processing each tile
padded_tile = torch.nn.functional.pad(tile, (pad_size, pad_size, pad_size, pad_size), mode='reflect')
```

## 3. Content-Aware Seam Finding

**How it works:** Similar to techniques used in image stitching:
- Find optimal seams between tiles where the transition is least noticeable
- Use dynamic programming to identify paths of minimal visual difference
- Blend along these optimal seams rather than in predefined regions

## 4. Progressive Resizing

**How it works:** Process the image at multiple scales:
- Start with a smaller version of the image that fits in memory
- Progressively upscale and refine details
- Each refinement pass uses information from previous scales

## 5. Frequency Domain Blending

**How it works:** Blend tiles in the frequency domain rather than spatial domain:
- Convert overlapping regions to frequency domain using FFT
- Blend frequency components with weighted averaging
- Convert back to spatial domain
- Particularly effective for preserving texture continuity

## 6. Attention-Based Tile Merging

**How it works:** Use an additional neural network to learn optimal blending:
- Train a small network specifically to merge tile boundaries
- The network learns to recognize and correct typical boundary artifacts
- Can be fine-tuned on your specific model's outputs

## 7. Consistency Enforcement Networks

**How it works:** Add a secondary network that enforces consistency:
- Process the full image at lower resolution
- Use this as a guide to ensure consistency between high-resolution tiles
- The low-res guide provides global context for local tile processing

## Implementation in BasicSR

To implement these techniques in BasicSR, you could:

1. Modify the inference code in [basicsr/models/sr_model.py](cci:7://file:///d:/personal%20projects/samsung/BasicSR/basicsr/models/sr_model.py:0:0-0:0) to include weighted blending
2. Add a post-processing step that handles tile merging with one of these techniques
3. Create a custom tile processor that handles the advanced blending logic

The simplest approach would be to implement weighted blending with a cosine window function, which provides smooth transitions while being computationally efficient.

Would you like me to provide a more detailed implementation for any of these techniques specifically for your model?
